title: Rails Links 001
date: 25/06/2010

As an experiment, I'm going to start making a link-post every so often. Maybe weekly? We'll see.

* Eric Davis provides a big [list of Capistrano variables](http://theadmin.org/articles/2010/06/24/capistrano-variables/) (via [larkgroup](http://larkware.com/shots))
* Fabio Akita took the opportunity to [interview](http://www.rubyinside.com/quality-interviews-with-10-rubyists-and-bob-martin-3458.html) a bunch of folks at RailsConf (via [RubyInside](http://rubyinside.com))
* You still have time to take Hampton Catlin's 2010 [Ruby Survey](http://survey.hamptoncatlin.com/)
* Some thoughts on [the new Ruby ecosystem](http://ducktypo.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-ruby-ecosystem.html) from Paolo Perrotta (via [coder.io](http://coder.io))

Also, feedback appreciated. Is this sort of post useful, informative, handy? Or overdone, redundant, irrelevant? Somewhere in between?
