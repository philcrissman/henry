Taptaptap made an extension that <a href="http://taptaptap.com/blog/speaking-of-comments/">adds comments</a> to <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, and, as you can see in the comments, sparked a little debate on whether or not this was A Good Thing.

It's fine. I mean, I don't really care if I can comment on DF or not, but if someone wants to, and if people use this and like it, great. It's the web. You can't control how people view your page. They could view it on any browser, with any extension, greasemonkey script, or other shenanigans inbetween, and there is absolutely nothing you or I can do about it.

They can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865/">block</a> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">your</a> <a href="http://safariadblock.com/">ads</a>. And that's fine, because it's their computer, and they can do that if they want to. Period.

They can implement their own stylesheets for your site (yes! they can!) and they will never again see the letter-spacing and line-height choices you painstakingly tested and implemented the last time you redesigned your blog. They can view your articles through <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> or something like it.

It just is. That's just how the web is set up to work. And it's a good thing. _It doesn't matter_.
