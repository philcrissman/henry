title: "Rails: Testing Your Floating Point Numbers"
date: 17/04/2009

You're being a Good Software developer and diligently testing all your code, and lo and behold, you get this result to one of your tests:

<code>
1) Failure: ... &lt;1.0&gt; expected but was &lt;1.0&gt;
</code>

An annoying problem with floats that might look and for all practical purposes be equal, but internally as stored by the computer are not <em>precisely</em> equal.

You're probably using:

<pre lang="ruby">
assert_equal 1.0, a_value_expected_to_be_1.0
</pre>

Instead, use:

<pre lang="ruby">
assert_in_delta 1.0, a_value_expected_to_be_1.0, 0.000001
</pre>

Though, you may also want to ask yourself if you really need to be using floating point numbers; but assuming that you <em>do</em> need them, <code>assert_in_delta</code> will compensate for the annoying fact that floating point numbers might not actually be precisely what you expect them to be.
