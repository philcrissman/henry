Quite often I'll come into a Rails project with a good portion of the code already written. Depending on style the developers were using, this sometimes means that I may not be able to easily tell, when looking at a given view, how the view is being generated. The URL may _say_ /pages/1, but for all I know, the routes file has instructions to use the ArmpitsController when it sees a route for pages/*; the URL might say /user/login, but for all we know, that may map to SessionController::sign_in. In other words, it's not always clear.

And that's not even getting into the cases where there are multiple partials being used, some of which might be in app/views/shared, or who knows where.

We've talked in the office a few times about a mythical plugin that could provide a little output stating exactly what controller, action, and template are being rendered, as well as any and all partials. Thus the idea for WhinyRendering was born.

If any of the preceding scenario sounds familiar, I hope it's helpful.
